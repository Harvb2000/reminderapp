# Reminderer app readme

## What is the reminderer app

The reminderer app is a simple timer web app. It allows the user to set different timers that when finished notifies the user when it is done.

## What can it do

The reminderer app has two settings at this state in development:
. Countdown: Lets the user set a reminder title, description and timer duration. It counts down from the set duration time and alerts the user once the timer has finished.
. Timer: Lets the user type a timer title and then starts an unlimited timer counting up.
